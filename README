Description:
PekSysTray is a system tray "notification area" dockapp similar to the GNOME
notification area applet. But it's designed for any window manager supporting 
docking. It created blocks that contains the icons, when a block is full (no 
more space for other icons) a new block is created.

Requirements:
X, gcc.

Installation:
make
make install

Running:
peksystray --help ;-)

Example:
* To have horizontal lines of four icons of 16x16 (the default):
peksystray
* For WindowMaker, blocks of 64x64 containing 4 icons:
peksystray --border 2 --icon-size 30 --width 64 --height 64
* To have one new window per icon:
peksystray --icon-size 48 --width 48 --height 48
